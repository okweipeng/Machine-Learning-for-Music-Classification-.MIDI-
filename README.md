# Machine Learning for Music Classification

# ---
# Overview
# ---
# A machine learning pipeline for classifying classical music compositions by six renowned composers using MIDI files. 
# The project employs feature extraction, preprocessing, and classification models like SVM, Logistic Regression, 
# and Gradient Boosting, aiming for accuracy above 90%.

# ---
# Features
# ---
# - Feature Extraction: Using `music21` to extract musical features (e.g., notes, chords, and N-grams).
# - Data Preprocessing: Includes normalization, outlier removal, and handling missing values.
# - Machine Learning Models: SVM, Logistic Regression, and Gradient Boosting classifiers.
# - Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1-score.
# - Research Documentation: Structured results presented in a research paper format.

# ---
# Workflow
# ---
# 1. MIDI File Preprocessing
#    - Filter and standardize MIDI files.
#    - Extract musical components like notes and chords using `music21`.
# 2. Feature Engineering
#    - Create N-grams to capture musical patterns.
#    - Generate statistical features from musical components.
# 3. Model Training and Testing
#    - Train machine learning models on extracted features.
#    - Perform hyperparameter tuning to optimize performance.
# 4. Evaluation
#    - Assess models using metrics like confusion matrix and classification reports.
# 5. Results Documentation
#    - Document findings in a structured research paper with sections for Abstract, 
#      Introduction, Methodology, Experiments, Results, and References.

# ---
# Dataset
# ---
# - **Source:** Classical music MIDI files from publicly available datasets.
# - **Classes:** Six composers (e.g., Bach, Beethoven, Mozart, Chopin, Schumann, Liszt).
# - **Preprocessing:** Files cleaned and processed using the `music21` library.

# ---
# Models
# ---
# 1. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**

# 2. **Logistic Regression**

# 3. **Gradient Boosting**

# ---
# Requirements
# ---
# - **Python (3.7+)**
# - **Core Libraries:** `numpy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`
# - **Music Analysis:** `music21`
# - **Visualization:** `matplotlib`, `seaborn`

# Install the required libraries:
# ```bash
# pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn music21 matplotlib seaborn
# ```

# ---
# Usage
# ---
# 1. Preprocess MIDI Files:
# ```python
# preprocessed_data = preprocess_midi(midi_data)
# ```
# 2. Feature Extraction:
# - Use `music21` to extract features from preprocessed data.
# 3. Train Machine Learning Models:
# ```python
# from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
# X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(features, labels, test_size=0.2)

# from sklearn.svm import SVC
# svm = SVC(kernel='rbf')
# svm.fit(X_train, y_train)
# ```
# 4. Evaluate the Model:
# ```python
# from sklearn.metrics import classification_report
# y_pred = svm.predict(X_test)
# print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
# ```

# ---
# Results
# ---
# - Achieved >90% accuracy across all models.
# - Confusion matrix highlights strong separation between classes (composers).
# - Insights: N-grams proved instrumental in improving classification accuracy.

# ---
# - **Libraries:** Thanks to `music21`, `scikit-learn`, and `matplotlib` for their powerful tools.
